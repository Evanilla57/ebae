# E-commerce Back End Starter Code


## Description

E-commerce plays a significant and expansive role within the electronics industry as well as modern society as a whole. It allows businesses and consumers to connect across the world to buy and sell goods across the internet. Due to the prevalence of e-commerce platforms, it is important to me as a coding student that I understand the fundamental architecture that allows these exchanges.

Working from starter code, I was able to build the back end for an e-commerce site using Express.js API as well as Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Tasks 

### User Story
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

### Accaptance Criteria
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
